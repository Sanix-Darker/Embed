# Embed.

A Browser Extension allowing you to watch videos or browse externals links everywhere in your browser!

### Introduction
I do not know if this is a whim or a need that haunts me, because I know I'm not alone sometimes in this situation! Having several tabs open on my browser including youtube for example, it gives me to have to change tabs to have a scene or to pause on a video that is in progress, not just the videos but who never wanted to be both on wikkipedia and see a video on youtube at the same time? And why stop there? Browse other sites or search directly in the same place!

### Features

- Watch videos in every tab on your browser (such as youtube).
- Browser externals link in the same place.
- Do some research, etc.. (bing search engine used here).
- light, Resizable, Dragable box.

### How it's works

- When a link is given to Embed, it generate a clone of the website you want to access.
- Some WebSite blocks that, so don't be surprise to get an empty preview.
- For Youtube, it's generate an embed video.
- When a text is given, the text do a simple request to bing.
